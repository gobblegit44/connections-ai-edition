# Connections: AI Edition

A sleek, mobile-friendly web game inspired by NYT Connections, where players group words into categoriesâ€”each representing an AI concept. Built with Three.js for neon visuals and particle effects.

## Features
- **AI-Themed Categories:** Each day, the game fetches 4 new AI-related categories, with 4 words in each group, generated by OpenAI. The words are shuffled for a fresh challenge daily.
- **Dynamic Daily Content:** Uses a secure Netlify Function to generate and serve new AI word groups every day. No API keys are exposed to the frontend.
- **Drag-and-Drop Gameplay:** Select and group tiles by dragging or tapping.
- **Sleek Neon UI:** Futuristic, glowing tiles and subtle particle effects using Three.js.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully mobile-friendly and text wraps inside tiles.

## How It Works
- On each visit, the game fetches a new set of 16 AI-related words (4 groups of 4) from a Netlify Function powered by OpenAI.
- The 16 words are shuffled and displayed on the grid. Players must deduce the hidden categories and group the words correctly.
- When a group is solved, its category name is revealed.
- If the backend/API is unavailable, the game falls back to a static set of AI categories and words.

## Local Development
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/connections-ai-edition.git
   cd connections-ai-edition
   ```
2. Start a local server (Python 3):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Deploying with Netlify
- Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) in your Netlify site settings.
- The Netlify Function at `netlify/functions/generateWords.js` handles all OpenAI requests securely.
- The frontend fetches daily word groups from `/.netlify/functions/generateWords`.

## Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JS
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for particle effects and visuals
- Netlify Functions for secure backend logic
- OpenAI API for daily AI word generation

## Customization
- To change fallback AI categories/words, edit the fallback groups in `main.js`.
- To adjust prompt or word formatting, edit the Netlify Function `generateWords.js`.
